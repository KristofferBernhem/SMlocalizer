		 * notes for 3D PRILM/Double Helix fitting.
		 * 
		 * Workflow:
		 * Background correct and fit each lobe independently
		 * In each frame, find closest neighbor. If no neighbor within OK range (from calibration file) discard point.
		 * For each pair, calculate angle between points. Check this against lookup table from calibration file for z. 
		 * TODO How to get eqvivalent sigma for z. 
		 * TODO How to get eqvivalent precision for z.
		 * 
		 * Calculate x,y at mean value of the two located lobes. 
		 * 
		 * Calibration file is generated by separate plugin that only generates a PRILM lookup table (in settings file). 
		 * Bead sample with sweeping focus in small, user provided, steps is required as input. 
		 * Calculate angle for each step and generate lookuptable with angle vs z-depth for the relevant fits (good original fit data).
		 * 
		 *  include dropdown menu for user to select which imaging mode the images are from.
		 *  
		 *  Add string from the modality choice to the localize calls and add call to modality specific function for 2D->3D translation after initial fitting, calling with the particle list. Return new particle list and update results table.
